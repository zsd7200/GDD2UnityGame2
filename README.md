#### Description
A requirement of this project was to create this game within the [world of The Dresden Files](http://www.jim-butcher.com/books/dresden), originally written by Jim Butcher.
Harry Dresden’s latest case is a suspected imposter within the White Council. When he enters the perpetrator’s study, he sees a note. The note reads: “Nice try, Dresden. You have twenty minutes before the magic artifacts in this room overload and take the whole building down!” After taking the note, the door vanishes! Dresden must follow the clues, solve the puzzles, and try to find the way out in time!

#### How to Play
- WASD to move
- Interact with objects with left-click
- Collect artifacts with right-click
- Drop items with middle-click
- Escape to Pause
- Q to view note again after taking it from the door

#### Win Condition
If the player collects all four runes, a message appears on screen, telling them how to escape.
